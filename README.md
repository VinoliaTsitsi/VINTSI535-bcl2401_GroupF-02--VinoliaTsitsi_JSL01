This project is something like a virtual pet adoption website.

I complete the validateSyntax function to check if the input string starts with "pet_" and is followed by a combination of letters and numbers.

The user has to enter in this way they start with Pet-year of birth-the name of the pet. They will then get a Validsyntax but 
if the user enter anything not in that order they will get an Invalid Syntaxt.
